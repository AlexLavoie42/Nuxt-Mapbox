# Custom Components
While it is recommended to use the default components, making your own is easy with the built in composables!


## Custom Popups & Markers

You can use ```defineMapboxPopup``` & ```defineMapboxMarker``` for custom marker & popup components
By passing a [template ref](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html) you can put custom html directly into your component.

Be sure to nest your custom components inside a map instance so the map-id can be auto injected. You can also pass the map ID manually into the functions.

If you pass `options` as a ref, the marker or popup will react to changes in settings.

Examples:
```js
      const popup = defineMapboxPopup(popupId, options, templateRef)
      popup?.setLngLat(lnglat)
```

**NOTE: Because of the way markers are implemented in Mapbox, if passing a template ref to defineMapboxPopup you have to define properties in a callback like so:**
```js
    const markerRef = defineMapboxMarker(markerId, options, templateRef, (marker) => {
        marker.setLngLat([110, 6])
    })
```

## Custom Map Component

If you would like to make your own map component, you can use ```defineMapboxInstance```

Example:
```js
    // NOTE: Map instance will be null on server & until it is loaded on client
    const map = defineMapboxInstance(MAP_DIV_ID, options);
```

## Custom Geocoder

If you want to use the geocoder without the map, use `MapboxCustomGeocoder` instead.
You can even use your own inputs!

Example:
```html
  <MapboxCustomGeocoder v-model="result" />
  <MapboxCustomGeocoder>
    <input>
  </MapboxCustomGeocoder>
```
```js
  const result = ref<MapboxGeocoder.Result>();
```
