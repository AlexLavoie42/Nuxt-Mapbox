## Events

All Map events are accessible directly through the component (With full Typescript support!)

View a list of events in the [Mapbox Docs](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map-events)

Example:

```html
    <MapboxMap
      ...
      @load="exampleFunction"
      @click="exampleFunction"
      @resize="exampleFunction"
    >
```

You can access [events directly on layers](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map.event:click) as well

Example:

```html
    <MapboxLayer
      ...
      @click="exampleFunction"
    >
```
