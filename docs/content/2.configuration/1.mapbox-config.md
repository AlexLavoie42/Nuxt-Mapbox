## Mapbox Config

You can configure Mapbox in your `nuxt.config.ts` file under `mapbox`. You must provide an API key here for maps to work.

Configuration options can be found in the [Mapbox documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/properties/).
Only settings applied directly to `mapboxgl` are configured here. Any map specific properties can be set directly with `useMapbox` at runtime.

## Persistent Map Instances
For map instances to be persistent across routes, `keepalive` must be set to `true` in [nuxt.config.ts](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#keepalive).
This is done by the module automatically, but you can disable it by setting the `persistent` option to `false` in `nuxt.config.ts`.

**Setting `keepalive` to false will not have any effect, so if you need to have it disabled be sure to use `persistent` instead**
